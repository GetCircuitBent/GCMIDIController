# Software Installation Instructions
## GC>MIDI Gamecube MIDI Controller

This guide will help with installing the software when you build your MIDI Interface, and is intended for those less familiar using Arduino IDE. If you're already familiar with the IDE, the ReadMe should have all the info you need, you might find this a bit tedious as it's meant for beginners.

## Install the Arduino IDE:
This step should be pretty straightforward, and there are lots of guides out there if you get stuck. So I will simply say to install the Arduino IDE.

You can use this link, or just Google "Install Arduino IDE" if this link ends up breaking down the road: [https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1)

## Install the Arduino Leonardo board using Boards Manager:

## Install the required Libraries using Library Manager:

## Download/Copy and Paste the Code:

## Upload the Code to the Device:

##Test!

## Software:
* See the [Code](https://github.com/po8aster/GCMIDIController/tree/master/Code) section to download or copy the code.
  * If you aren't familiar with Ardunio IDE, loading sketches, and loading libraries there are lots of great tutorials out there, and I won't try to recreate that info here. But Google those terms and you should be on your way!
* Required Libraries:
  * [MIDI Library - Francois Best](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/midi-library/)
  * [USB MIDI Library - Gary Grewal](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/MIDIUSB)
  * [Nintendo Library - NicoHood](https://github.com/NicoHood/Nintendo)
* If you want to change the USB MIDI Device Name after you've got it working, there is an excellent guide [here](http://liveelectronics.musinou.net/MIDIdeviceName.php) on how to do so. I am not quite sure how to credit the creator properly, but it was extremely helpful for me.
